# JuryRiggedFonts

A misc collection of partially modified fonts for my own projects — particularly useful in coding/scripting games and terminal-based visualizations.

These fonts are customized for better visual alignment, symbol usage, and stylistic consistency when working with monospaced UIs or game engines like **Godot**.

## 🔧 MonoJetBrains + Full Width/Height-Filled Glyphs

![Demo Screenshot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9ca139b-dc27-408b-8af3-453b40ab95ba)
The text used are:
```
◢█◣◆◆qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm
◥█◤◆◆qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm
 ▲    
◀█▶ 	
 ▼
 ▴
◂█▸
 ▾
 ```

This variant is based on **JetBrains Mono**, with modifications to specific characters for precise visual alignment. The following characters have been altered:
▲ ▴ ▶ ▸ ▼ ▾ ◀ ◂ ◆ █

These glyphs now fully occupy the **half-character block space** (either triangular or square fill), which is useful for:

- Terminal-based visual output
- Custom CLI art
- Pseudo-graphical UI in coding/simulation games
- Godot or similar engine text rendering where alignment is critical

## 💡 Notes

This is not intended for general-purpose use. The modifications serve niche rendering or visualization use cases — especially in games, simulations, or pseudo-GUI rendering within a text grid.

Use with care. Or not. JuryRig it as you wish.
