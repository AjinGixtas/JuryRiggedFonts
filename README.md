# JuryRiggedFonts

A misc collection of partially modified fonts for my own projects ‚Äî particularly useful in coding/scripting games and terminal-based visualizations.

These fonts are customized for better visual alignment, symbol usage, and stylistic consistency when working with monospaced UIs or game engines like **Godot**.

## üîß MonoJetBrains + Full Width/Height-Filled Glyphs

![Demo Screenshot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9ca139b-dc27-408b-8af3-453b40ab95ba)
The text used are:
```
‚ó¢‚ñà‚ó£‚óÜ‚óÜqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm
‚ó•‚ñà‚ó§‚óÜ‚óÜqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm
 ‚ñ≤    
‚óÄ‚ñà‚ñ∂ 	
 ‚ñº
 ‚ñ¥
‚óÇ‚ñà‚ñ∏
 ‚ñæ
 ```

This variant is based on **JetBrains Mono**, with modifications to specific characters for precise visual alignment. The following characters have been altered:
‚ñ≤ ‚ñ¥ ‚ñ∂ ‚ñ∏ ‚ñº ‚ñæ ‚óÄ ‚óÇ ‚óÜ ‚ñà

These glyphs now fully occupy the **half-character block space** (either triangular or square fill), which is useful for:

- Terminal-based visual output
- Custom CLI art
- Pseudo-graphical UI in coding/simulation games
- Godot or similar engine text rendering where alignment is critical
